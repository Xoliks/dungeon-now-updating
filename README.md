# Dungeon Now Loading
 
 ## Introduction
 
 Dungeon Now Loading 18% and beyond has been programmed using the [Bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt) scripting language and [ReaperMC](https://github.com/reapermc/reapermc) framework.
 
 ## Contribution
 
 Please make sure that any contributions are done inside the `src`, instead of directly editing the datapack and resourcepack (avoid editing anything inside the `build` folder). All of the functions, advancements, and most loot tables are generated from the `.bolt` files inside `modules` folder.
